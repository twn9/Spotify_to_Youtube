# Spotify_to_Youtube

I have writen a program that will get saved songs from spotify and transfer them to a youtube playlist. This program utilizes both the Spotify and Youtube data api to get the information. 

<ins>**Reasoning:**</ins>

The intention of this program was to streamline where our music should be. I often forget about a song that I enjoy becasue I have it saved on a different platform so I tried to develop a more syncronized solution. 

<ins>**Plans:**</ins>

I intend add more support for different platforms and make it possible to convert youtube playlists into other streaming services
